Hello, I have designed a GUI for image processing in Python that provides users with many features by using OpenCV to process images and Tkinter to design the graphical interface.We have provided nine features, as shown in the following figures, such as uploading the image, resizing the image, rotating the image, converting the image colors to black and white, and others.Attached here are two files for two projects I worked on, with some minor differences. Thank you.
